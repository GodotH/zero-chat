> **High-Precision Multi-Agent Reasoning Interface**

Zero-Chat is a web interface implementing the **MAKER framework** (Massively Decomposed Agentic Processes) to solve complex tasks with "zero error" reliability. It uses Google's Gemini 3 Pro model to decompose tasks into atomic steps, generate multiple candidate solutions for each step, and vote on the best outcome.

### 🔗 **Concept Paper**
This project is an implementation of the concepts discussed in:  
**[Solving a Million-Step LLM Task with Zero Errors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09030v1)**

## Key Features
- **MAKER Framework**: Automatic task decomposition, candidate generation, and voting.
- **Multimodal**: Analyze Images, PDFs, and Text files with rigorous verification.
- **Zero Error Protocol**: Red-flagging logic detects and discards hallucinated or lazy responses.
- **Cost Transparency**: Real-time tracking of token usage and estimated cost.
- **Resilience**: Auto-save history, zombie-task cleanup, and error boundaries.
